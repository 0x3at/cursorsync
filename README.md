# Cursor Settings Sync Extension: Development Breakdown

I'll help you elaborate on your development plan for the Cursor extension that syncs settings, extensions, and other utilities using VSCode API. Here's a detailed breakdown of implementation tasks for each feature:

## 1. Settings Sync

### User Settings Sync (GitHub Gists Storage)

#### User Authentication with GitHub

-   Implement OAuth flow for GitHub authentication using vscode authentication

#### Machine Association

-   **Read User Settings**
    -   Use VSCode configuration API to read user settings JSON
-   **Device Name Management**
    -   Implement UI prompt for device name input
    -   Store device metadata with timestamp and unique identifier
    -   Handle device name updates and duplicates
-   **Gist Operations**
    -   Create/read/update GitHub Gists via API
    -   Implement proper error handling for network failures
    -   Add retry logic for intermittent connection issues
    -   Create progress indicators for sync operations
-   **Metadata Schema**
    -   Design gist & JSON schema for settings metadata:

#### Master Device Management

-   **Config Reading**
    -   Fetch all configuration sets from GitHub Gists
    -   Parse and validate configurations against schema
    -   Display available configurations in quick-pick UI
-   **Default Flag Management**
    -   Store master device flag in metadata
    -   Implement logic for sync directionality based on master status
-   **Default Switching**
    -   Add command to change master device
    -   Update all devices' metadata when master changes
    -   Implement validation to ensure only one master exists
    -   Handle race conditions with timestamp-based resolution
-   **Config Freeze Functionality**
    -   Create UI for marking settings as frozen/hot
    -   Implement frozen settings detection during sync
    -   Add visual indicators for frozen/hot settings in UI
    -   Create bidirectional sync logic for hot settings

## 2. Extension Syncing

### Multiple Extension Lists

-   **Extension Reading**
    -   Use `vscode.extensions.all` to enumerate installed extensions
    -   Capture extension IDs, versions, and enabled status
    -   Handle workspace vs. user extensions differently
-   **Metadata Structure**
    -   Design extension list schema:
    -   Allow categorizing extensions by profile
    -   Add support for multiple named lists (e.g., "Frontend", "Python", "Full")
-   **Gist Storage**
    -   Store extension lists in separate gist or section
    -   Implement efficient diffing to minimize data transfer
    -   Add versioning and conflict resolution

### Optional Extension Cleaning

-   Create toggle setting for automatic cleaning
-   Implement extension comparison logic:
    -   Generate diff between installed and sync list
    -   Create UI to display extensions to be removed
    -   Add confirmation dialog with detailed changes
-   Handle dependency relationships between extensions
-   Implement uninstall operation with progress reporting

## 3. History, Backups, and Rollback Utilities

### Settings Change Tracking

-   Implement versioned history in gist structure
-   Store incremental diffs to minimize storage requirements
-   Create history viewer UI with filtering options
-   Implement search functionality for settings changes

### Rollback Functionality

-   Create rollback command with version selection
-   Implement logic to restore previous configurations
-   Add support for selective rollbacks (specific settings only)
-   Create preview diff before applying rollback
-   Implement validation to prevent broken configurations
-   Add backup of current state before rollback

## Cross-Feature Implementation Requirements

### Error Handling

-   Implement robust try/catch throughout the codebase
-   Create informative error messages with troubleshooting steps
-   Add logging system for diagnostic information

### Conflict Resolution

-   Design conflict resolution strategy with manual and automatic options
-   Create UI for resolving conflicts with clear visual diffs
-   Implement three-way merge for complex conflicts

### Performance Optimization

-   Implement throttling for API calls to avoid rate limits
-   Add compression for settings transfer
-   Create incremental update system to minimize data transfer

### Security

-   Implement secure token storage using VSCode secrets API
-   Add option to exclude sensitive settings from sync
-   Create data validation to prevent injection attacks

This development plan breaks down each feature into concrete implementation tasks that you can check off as you complete them. Would you like me to elaborate further on any specific feature?
